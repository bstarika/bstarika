- 👋 Hi... I’m Breanna!
- 👀 I’m looking for: A full-time software developer position! I currently live in Denver, Colorado but I am open to relocating and/or remote work. I prefer back-end programming, specifically working with C#. However, I am prepared to work as a full-stack developer and I am eager to learn more technologies and languages.
- ❤️ Besides coding, I enjoy: staying active, and play lots of video games!
- 📫 How to reach me: starikabreanna@gmail.com OR https://www.linkedin.com/in/breannastarikasoftwaredeveloper/
